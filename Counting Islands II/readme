描述
Country H is going to carry out a huge artificial islands project. The project region is divided into a 1000x1000 grid. The whole project will last for N weeks. Each week one unit area of sea will be filled with land.

As a result, new islands (an island consists of all connected land in 4 -- up, down, left and right -- directions) emerges in this region. Suppose the coordinates of the filled units are (0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 0). Then after the first week there is one island:  

#...
....
....
....
After the second week there are two islands:  

#...
.#..
....
....
After the three week the two previous islands are connected by the newly filled land and thus merge into one bigger island:

#...
##..
....
....
Your task is track the number of islands after each week's land filling.  

输入
The first line contains an integer N denoting the number of weeks. (1 ≤ N ≤ 100000)  

Each of the following N lines contains two integer x and y denoting the coordinates of the filled area.  (0 ≤ x, y < 1000)

输出
For each week output the number of islands after that week's land filling.
